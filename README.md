# hello-world
First repository - Alpha tests

Well, here i'd like to talk litle bit about myself. I'm a begginer in this code world, but with a lot of curiosity.
I'm a front-end developer -> HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, some frameworks like Bootstrap too.
In the Back, i've got some skills in PHP. (For now, learning how to built some databases with MySQL)
